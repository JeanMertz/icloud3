iCloud3 v2.3.1 Change Log
=========================

1/19/2021
---------
1. Bug fixed with unit_of_measurement when it was specified in the config_ic3.yaml as 'km'. The unit_of_measurement ('mi' or 'km') would be displayed correctly but the value being displayed was always the miles value.

1/18/2021
---------
1. Rewrote the routine used to decode configuration parameters in the config_ic3.yaml file to eliminate redundant and complicated code, to make it easier to add new parameters and to make it more efficient.
2. Update the sample automation and scripts.
3. Updated the documentation.

1/17/2021
---------
1. Bug fix when the devicename was duplicated in the Family Sharing List. If an older device has the same name as the newer device, the location was being requested for the older device instead of the newer device. The older devicename probably does not exist anymore so no location information was returned for it.
2. Bug fix when optimizing the device's tracking method. The Family Sharing tracking method was always selected for all devices if they were all in the Family Sharing list and in the Frinds list on the FindMy App. In this situation, the Find-my-Friends tracking method should be assigned to each device.

1/16/2021
---------
1. Removed zone_name_1/2/3 and last_zone_1/2/3 sensors.

1/13/2021
---------
1. Bug fix when specifying the zone parameter in configuration file for a device. It should be 'track_from_zone'.
2. Bug fix when specifying how the zone displayed (display_zone_as: fname). It was always displaying the zone's name instead of the friendly name.

1/12/2021
---------
1. Initial release of v2.3.
