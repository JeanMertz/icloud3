iCloud3 v2.3.1 Change Log
=========================

1/17/2021
1. Fixed a problem caused by duplicate devicenames in the Family Sharing List. If an older device has the same name as the newer device, the location was being requested for the older device instead of the newer device. The older devicename probably does not exist anymore so no location information was returned for it.
2. Fixed a problem where the Family Sharing tracking method was always selected for all devices if they were all in both the Family Sharing list and in the Frinds list on the FindMy App. In this situation, the Find-my-Friends tracking method should be assigned to each device.

1. Removed zone_name_1/2/3 and last_zone_1/2/3 sensors.

1/13/2001
1. Fixed problem with zone parameter in configuration file
2. Fixed problem displaying the zone's friendly name
