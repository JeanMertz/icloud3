v2.4.6 (10/11/2021)
1. Changed the icon for zones from mdi:cellphone-iphone to mdi:cellphone because of Home Assistant mdi update.
2. Changed the sensor state values for Travel Time, Distance, Next Update Time, etc. from an empty field to a value to address a Lovelace display change. The fields that were empty were not alligned with the field next to them. Travel Time will now display 0 min when in a zone. Other fields will display '___' when empty.

v2.4.5 (10/5/2021)
