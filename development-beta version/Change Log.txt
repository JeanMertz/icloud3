v2.3.6b1 (2/28/2021)
1. Revamped the way the configuration parameters are retrieved from HA, how they are processed and how iCloud3 is set up based on the parameters.
2. Combined the processing of the parameters from configuration.yaml and config_ic3.yaml to use common routines. They are edited using common routines and invalid values are reset to the default value.
3. The track_from_zone parameter can now accept multiple zones using the zone name or the friendly name.

v2.3.6b2 (3/9/2021)
1. Fixed a problem where the Event Log would not display when the iOS App and iC3 Zone names contained an 's (e.g., Barry'sHouse). 
2. Updated the Event Log card version number check to support the v#.#.#b# (e.g., v2.3.6b2) numbering scheme.
